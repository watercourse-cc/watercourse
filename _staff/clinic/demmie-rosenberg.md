I work with adolescents, adults, families and couples.

I have many years of experience working as a therapist and in health care as a registered nurse. I possess competencies in relationship building and thinking systematically about change.

> I believe in the power of change and that something we perceive as an obstacle can be overcome by changing the way we look at it.
