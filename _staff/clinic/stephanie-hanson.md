I work with children, adolescents, adults, couples and families, survivors of trauma, those with attachment issues and those experiencing grief and loss.

Through my work as a counselor I have had the privilege of helping children and adults of various races and backgrounds nurture their strengths, sense of self and personal efficacy. My competencies include working with clients facing anxiety and depressive disorders, trauma, and adjustment to life changes, as well as play therapy and group therapy facilitation.  My background includes working with survivors of domestic abuse, children in day treatment, and people who are homeless and highly mobile.  I joined Watercourse Counseling Center in 2006.

> My therapeutic approach is eclectic and strength-based. It combines supportive, behavioral, cognitive and psychodynamic techniques.  I see therapy as a journey with many paths and many possible outcomes, and believe the most essential tool to navigating this journey is the relationship built between the client and the therapist. Everyone has a unique reality and deserves understanding and acceptance, and I hope to help those I work with connect with and appreciate their authentic self.
