*"I believe growth and change begin when you feel safe and know you have a therapist you can trust. I believe in being genuine and bring my full attention, insights, and self to our sessions. I listen actively and will never judge you. My clients tell me that in our work together, they feel unconditionally accepted while also feeling challenged to grow."*
