I work with children/adolescents, adults, trauma, LGBT, Native American, victims/witnesses of domestic violence, attachment (children and adults), and various religious concerns.

I have competency in play therapy, trauma and attachment, sand tray work, relational psychodynamic psychotherapy, group therapy, and completing level 1 trauma training through Senoriation psychotherapy institute. I have experience as a childrenâ€™s therapist with the Domestic Abuse Project, Jewish Family and Children Services, and approximately 10 years working with kids in residential settings, crisis work, and mental health case management.

I believe in working collaboratively to help clients to validate and accept themselves and to identify and change thoughts and behaviors that contribute to mental health concerns.

> Therapy is a process and I believe my job is to help the client discover and trust his or her own therapeutic process. I also believe in a holistic approach  addressing emotions, bodily sensations, and spirituality when appropriate.
