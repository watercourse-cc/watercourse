## Andersen United School

### Lul Nur, MA
 
I work with children and adolescents with a range of mental health issues including: depression, anger, anxiety, behavioral issues, family conflict, grief and loss, hyperactivity, academic and social difficulties, and trauma. I mainly work with the Latino, East African, and African American populations and support children and adolescents with specific mental health needs.
 
#### Experience:

I have worked with children at the YMCA and Minneapolis Kids. I have volunteered at Lutheran Social services where I interacted with recent immigrants and Juvenile Detention Center at Hennepin County. I am working toward completing the licensing requirement to become a Licensed Mental Health Counselor. I am fluent in Somali, Arabic, and English Languages. I am interested in working more with children and adolescents with ADHD and conduct disorders.
 
I have training in play therapy, trauma focus cognitive therapy and I am currently working as a co-facilitator for parenting through change, a group using the Parent Management training-Oregon Model (PMTO). Through my experience conducting these parenting groups, I have learned the issues facing East African parents (e.g. issues with discipline, lack of communication, and managing conflict).  
 
#### My counseling philosophy:

I believe in the power of the therapeutic relationship to help individuals discover their own uniqueness and strive for independence.

## Loring Elementary

### Felor Rostami, MA, LGSW
 
I work with children, adolescents, and families. I enjoy providing services to my client in an environment with safety and no judgement. I have worked with children with disruptive behavior, anxiety and depression.
 
#### Experience:
 
I have experience working in a transition program for the past 14 years at Mounds View School district with the age group of 18-21. I have also worked at the after school program with K-5 for YMCA in Shore view for the past 14 years. I received my undergrad in Social Work and my Master’s degree in Marriage and Family Therapy from St. Mary’s University.
 
I was born in Iran to a Muslim family and I spent most of my youth growing up in a Middle Eastern culture. I moved to the United States as a teenager and soon realized there are many difference between the two cultures. As an Iranian-American I had the opportunity to have the best of both worlds. I am fluent in Farsi (Persian) and English languages.  I come from a cultural background that values the importance of a strong family system and generational support. I believe I can incorporate my personal life experiences into my therapy sessions with families to create a constructive learning experience.    
 
#### Counseling philosophy:
 
I believe building relationship and trust is the key factor to a successful therapeutic setting between the client, therapist and their families.  My therapeutic mission is to enhance the individual’s life by promoting developmental professional counseling while using play therapy techniques.
